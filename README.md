Project 1: an app for everything dads in honor of Father's Day

AS A...

dad or person with similar interests

I WANT...

to see weather conditions and maybe a silly joke

SO THAT...

I can decide if I want to mow grass today

## Future Updates

In new updates, we want to add a sales element to the page so that our user story looks more attractive.

## Technologies Used

We chose [https://materializecss.com/] as our CSS Framework.
