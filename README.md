Project 1: an app for everything dads in honor of Father's Day

## About

This is a simple app with a simple user story:

`AS A...`

dad or person with similar interests

`I WANT...`

to see weather conditions and maybe a silly joke

`SO THAT...`

I can decide if I want to mow grass today

## Future Updates

In new updates, we want to add a sales element to the page so that our user story looks more attractive. We also want to add more content so that we reach a broader audience, while not losing sight of the original idea of the page.

## Technologies Used

We chose [https://materializecss.com/] as our CSS Framework.

Joke API: [https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/]

OpenWeather API: [https://openweathermap.org/api]

The Odds API: [https://the-odds-api.com/]
